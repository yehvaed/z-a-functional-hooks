  <p> An annex delivers the capability to use functions instead of params hooks </p>
</h2>

# Install

Simply load like a regular plugin, i.e.:

```zsh
zi light yehvaed/z-a-functional-hooks
```

After executing this command you can use function named the same as a hook.

```zsh
    atclone() {
        # run code at clone
    }

    atpull() {
        # run code at pull
    }

    atinit() {
        # run code at init
    }

    atload() {
        # run code at load
    }
    
    zi light z-shell/null
}

```
